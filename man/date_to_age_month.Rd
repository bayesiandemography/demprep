\title{Convert dates to one-month age groups}
\usage{
date_to_age_month(date, dob, break_min = 0, break_max = 1200, open_last = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{date}{Dates of events.
A vector of class \code{\link[base]{Date}},
or a vector that can be coerced to class
\code{Date} using function \code{\link[base]{as.Date}}.}

\item{dob}{Dates of birth.
A vector of class \code{\link[base]{Date}},
or a vector that can be coerced to class
\code{Date} using function \code{\link[base]{as.Date}}.}

\item{break_min}{An integer or \code{NULL}.
Defaults to 0.}

\item{break_max}{An integer or \code{NULL}.
Defaults to 1200.}

\item{open_last}{Whether the final age group
has no upper limit. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A factor with the same length as
\code{date} or \code{dob}, whichever
is longer.
}
\description{
Given the dates when events occurred,
and the dates of birth of the people experiencing the events,
allocate the events to age groups. These
age groups all have widths of one month,
except possibly the final age group.
}
\details{
A person belongs to age group \code{"x"} if that
person was exactly \code{x} months
old at their most recent birthday.
For instance, a person belongs to age
group \code{"60m"} if that person had their
5th birthday (= 60 months) two days ago.

\code{date} and \code{dob} must have the same length,
unless one of them has length 1, in which case the
length-1 argument is recycled.

If \code{break_min} or \code{break_max} is set to \code{NULL},
rather than to a specific value, then \code{date_to_age_year}
finds the narrowest range that accommodates the data.

When \code{open_last} is \code{TRUE}, the final age group
is "open", which means that it has no upper limit.
(The definition of an open interval in demography is
is different from the definition of an open interval
in mathematics.)

The return value is a factor. The levels of this
factor contain all intermediate age groups,
including ones that do not appear in the data.

If \code{date} or \code{dob} contain \code{NA}, then the
levels of the factor created by \code{date_to_age_custom}
will also contain \code{NA}.

\examples{
date_to_age_month(date = c("2024-03-27",
                           "2022-11-09"),
                  dob = c("2021-03-21",
                          "2020-07-13"))

## specify highest age group
date_to_age_month(date = "2019-10-22",
                  dob = "2018-01-01",
                  break_max = 24)

## let lowest age group be set by the data
date_to_age_month(date = "2019-10-22",
                  dob = "2018-01-01",
                  break_min = NULL,
                  break_max = 24)

## make final age group closed
date_to_age_month(date = "2019-10-22",
                  dob = "2018-01-01",
                  break_min = NULL,
                  break_max = 24,
                  open_last = FALSE)
