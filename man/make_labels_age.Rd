\title{Make labels for age groups measured in years}
\usage{
make_labels_age(breaks, open_last = TRUE, include_na = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{breaks}{A integer vector, or a vector that can
be coerced to integer via function \code{\link[base]{as.integer}}.}

\item{open_last}{Whether to append an open-ended
age group to the end of the labels.
Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{include_na}{Whether to append an \code{NA} to
the end of the labels. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A character vector.
}
\description{
Make labels for age groups with lengths measured in
whole years. The labels follow standard
demographic conventions.
}
\details{
Age groups are defined via the \code{breaks} argument.
The elements of \code{breaks} must be non-negative integers,
and must be strictly increasing.  
Labels for single-year age groups, eg from birth to exact age 1, from
exact age 1 to exact age 2, and so on, take the form
\code{"0", "1", "2", ...}. Labels for multi-year age groups,
eg from birth to exact age 5, from exact age 5 to
exact age 10, and so on, take the form \code{"0-4", "5-9", ...}.

When \code{open_last} is \code{TRUE}, an 'open' age
group with no upper limit is appended to the end of the labels.
By default, \code{open_last} is \code{TRUE}.

When \code{include_na} is \code{TRUE}, an \code{NA}
is added to the end of the labels. This can be useful
when dealing with dates that include \code{NA}s.

\code{breaks} can only have length 0 if \code{open_last}
is \code{FALSE}. \code{breaks} can
have only have length 1 if \code{open_last}
is \code{TRUE}.

\examples{
## single-year
make_labels_age(breaks = 0:100)

## 5-year
make_labels_age(breaks = seq(0, 80, 5))

## mixed
make_labels_age(breaks = c(0, 1, 4, seq(5, 80, 5)))

## no open age group
make_labels_age(breaks = seq(15, 65, 5))

## allow for missing
make_labels_age(breaks = seq(15, 65, 5),
                      include_na = TRUE)
}
\seealso{
To make labels for periods measured in years, use
\code{\link{make_labels_period}}, and to
make labels for cohorts, use \code{\link{make_labels_cohort}}.
To make labels for age groups with widths of one quarter or one month,
use functions \code{\link{make_labels_age_quarter}} or
\code{\link{make_labels_age_month}}.
