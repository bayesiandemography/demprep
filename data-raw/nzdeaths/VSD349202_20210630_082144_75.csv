"Footnotes:"
"Deaths data are based on deaths registered in New Zealand to people resident in New Zealand by date of registration."
"Neonatal deaths are deaths of children under four weeks of age. Post-neonatal deaths are deaths of children from four weeks up to one year of age. Infant deaths are deaths of children under one year of age."
"In May and June 2014 the Department of Internal Affairs registered a significant number (51) of neonatal deaths that had occurred in 2011 and 2012."
"Therefore neonatal and infant deaths for the June 2014 quarter are higher than other periods, and 2011 and 2012 figures are lower than they would have been if these deaths were registered at the time they occurred."
"Quarterly and annual fluctuations in neonatal and infant deaths and death rates should be treated with caution. For further information please visit DataInfo+ (http://datainfoplus.stats.govt.nz/Item/nz.govt.stats/24c7f58a-7a19-4ac5-b66f-374c563932bf)"
